Examples of command line options for each task


>> summarize performance times
-task summarize -metric performance -folder <absolute-path>

<absolute-path> points towards folder containing performance results text files to be summarized


>> summarize memory usage
(example: summarize memory usage of AndroJena engine)

-task summarize -metric memory -folder <absolute-path> -className wvw.mobibench.engine.AndroJena

<absolute-path> points towards folder with following structure:
<folder>
	conv/ (folder containing hprof-conv converted heap dumps to be summarized; create this folder)


>> compare performance times
(example: compare performance of "inf-inst, inst-entailed, entailed" OWL2 RL rule subset vs. full ruleset (i.e., no selection) for androjena engine)

-task compare -e1 androjena -t1 owl2rl -d1 ore-small -e2 androjena -t2 owl2rl -s2 inf-inst,entailed -d2 ore-small_mat-ont_inst-entailed -folder <absolute-path>

<absolute-path> points towards folder with following structure:
<folder>
	<engine-id-1>
		full/
			[ performance results text files ]
		<selections-1>/ (comma-separated; e.g., "entailed, extra-axioms")
			[ performance results text files ]
		...
	<engine-id-2>
		...
