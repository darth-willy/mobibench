- some rules could be removed, but actually serve as replacement for other rules
prp-symp (SymmetricProperty): prp-inv2 could only be removed (in part) due to this rule
so, we certainly still need that rule
	previously thought this may have been a false positive..
but correctly indicated as rule-to-keep by web service function 	


- lack of "self-subProperties" could technically lead to some rules (incorrectly) not being added to red4
e.g., LinkRestriction rules; headOf should be subproperty of itself
	doesn't seem to be the case now though
	

- future work: 
 	try out additional optimizations (SwiftOWLIM docs): 
		for instance, these could be supported virtually (i.e., at query time): 
		- for each resource, inferring types such as owl:Thing, rdf:Resource
		- for each resource & property, in case they participate in subClassOf & subPropertyOf statements, infer Class & Property types
		- via reflexivity of owl:sameAs, generate essentially the same statement twice
		- for each class, inferring it is a subclass of owl:Thing, and type rdfs:Class
