flag conf2/ dataset as inconsistent
	(not AndroJena)

OWL scope: doesn't work with conf/ dataset
	complains about illegal list structure

heap dumps for some test cases cannot be parsed (tried multiple times)
	(see BenchmarkUtils/failed_generateDumpReport.txt)
	
the following rule doesn't work in AndroJena:

	[R6: 
	(?p <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#IrreflexiveProperty>)
	(?x ?p ?x)
	->
	(?p <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://spinrdf.org/spin#ViolationIrreflexiveProperty>)
	]
	
(apparently, due to "(?x ?p ?x) part; if one of the x'es is replaced by another variable & accompanied by FILTER
	sameAs, it does work ..)

conf/ dataset: throws java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 
	'org.semanticweb.elk.util.collections.chains.Chain org.semanticweb.elk.reasoner.indexing.hierarchy.
	IndexedClassExpression.getCompositionRuleChain()' on a null object reference

conf2/ dataset: no inferences

huge amount of output to console; will likely slow down inferencing
	in fact, eclipse crashes when opening logcat tool for 10 runs
